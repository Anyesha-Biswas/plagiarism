# 🔍 Plagiarism Detection System

This project is a simple **Plagiarism Detection System** that helps identify textual similarities between documents using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It's built for educational and academic use, and demonstrates basic methods for comparing the similarity between texts.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Compare two or more text files for similarity.
- Calculates plagiarism percentage based on similarity.
- Highlights matched content (optional extension).
- User-friendly interface (CLI or web-based).
- Can be integrated into academic submission systems.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** (Core logic)
- **NLTK / Scikit-learn** (For text preprocessing and similarity)
- **Flask / Streamlit** *(Optional if using a web UI)*
- **HTML/CSS/JS** *(Frontend if web version exists)*

## ▶️ How to Run

### 💻 Option 1: Command Line
```bash
python main.py
```

### 🌐 Option 2: Web Interface
If using Flask:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
Then open `http://localhost:5000/` in your browser.
